Job listing website that displays job titles and descriptions from an external API. It allows users to view job details for multiple companies and navigate through different job listings by clicking on company names. The application is efficient and user-friendly, with fast loading times and easy-to-use navigation.

React and its hooks, such as useState and useEffect, simplify state management and API data fetching. The code also implements conditional rendering to display a loading state and render job information based on user selection. Additionally, the use of a key prop on job items ensures efficient rendering of items in the list.
